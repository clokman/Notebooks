# Change Log

## All Sheets
- Sheets are numbered on headers, and also added numbers to each box for easy reference (e.g., for referring them on Piazza as 'see box 2.7', or 'Sheet 2, box 7')

- All boxes now made more distinctive with background coloring and separators between them

- Color themes: Each page and section now has a distinct color theme, to make it easier to distinguish them from each other.


## Sheet 1 - Entailment and Propositional Logic
- Enhanced readability and colors
- Typos fixed
- Created an alternative shorter version for UvA. This version is under Alternative Versions directory

## Sheet 2 - RDF & RDFS
- Added a 'more on this later' reference to turtle syntax sheet 
- Added a brief explanation on prefixes and also an arrow to the example prefixes on the same sheet
