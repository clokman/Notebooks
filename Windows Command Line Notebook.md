Notebook: Windows command line

## Reaching Parent Directories
***..\***

Paths are relative to the launcher. So, if I want to launch PStart.exe, which is 3 directories "up" from Portable StrokeIt.exe, I should type 

"..\..\..\Pstart.exe" 

Don't forget to include the double quotes, otherwise you may get an error message. And use backslash not "/". You probably know that but I write it here that "..\" goes back one directory and ".\" means the same directory. 

## Same Directory
***.\***

".\" means the same directory.
